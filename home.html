<p>Eddie Brock's life as an investigative reporter with his own online show fell apart after he went after Carlton Drake and the Life Foundation, who had recently brought back alien subjects from a secretive crashed space mission. Brock was fired from his job and lost his fiancee Anne Weying, who lost her job after Brock improperly used legal information from her to accuse Drake. However, Brock was pulled back into his investigation of the Life Foundation by one of the company's doctors, who wanted to shed light on the fatal testing being done on homeless citizens of San Francisco.

The Life Foundation was attempting to create a bond between a human and the alien symbiotes they brought back to Earth. After Eddie Brock broke into the lab, he was attacked by one of the failed symbiote bonds that led to his first encounter with the Venom symbiote. Meanwhile, another symbiote was able to escape the crash and violently made its way to San Francisco, eventually bonding with Carlton Drake to create the villain known as Riot. Venom and Eddie were able to find new strength in their bond, and a new mission to stop Riot from calling down an invasion of symbiotes. Venom was able to stop Riot and save his career as Eddie Brock while renewing a friendship with Anne, which all led to a highly touted interview with an incarcerated serial killer: Cletus Kasady.
