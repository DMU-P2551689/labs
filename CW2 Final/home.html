<!-- <body>
     The body element was used to make the the image the background for the entire page.
     background-repeat: no-repeat; prevented the background image from repeating itself when you scrollLeft.
     background-attachment: fixed; fixed the image in place so it moves as you scroll.-->

     float: left; was used to position the image to the left of text.
     padding-right: 10px; created a spereation between the image and the text.
     margin was used to position the image on the page.
     border radius created an oval shaped effect for the image -->
